		    	  	<P> Back to the story, <u><b>Jean Jacques Iradukunda</b></u> was born on 16th June, 1994. In this period, the country was in ridiculous period because the Genocide was happening. His father fled the country and he stayed with the mother because she could not go for refuge. Jean Jacques had 3 elders including two sisters and a brother, who had fled with thier father. Sometime after the genocide, his elders came back but his father did not for unknown reasons. As he grew up, he started his studies straight with the primary because there were no nursary schools in his village </P>

		    	  	<P>On the first day, his sister took him to the nearest Primary school known as Ecole Primaire Saint Paul Mukimbagiro where he spent his first six years. In that journey, Jean Jacques acquired new friends, learned a lot even though he had difficulties with <b><u>Mathematics</b></u> as one of the difficult subjects for him. One of the memories is that he was said to have <i>a wife</i>, a story told by other kids in the primary school. His primary studies ending was the most pleasing for his family members because none of his elders has ever succedded the national examination, but he did it. Talking to his dady, he said: <q><i><u> He is the first in my children to pass a National Exam, to go to a Public school</q></i></u>. He really inspires us (his parents), and his elders as well.</P>


		    	  	<p>At the end of his primary school, Jean Jacques was oriented to Gishoma Excellent School where he went  for his Ordinary Level Studies. As he was the champion, he was also able to pass the National Ordinary Level Examination and was Referred to TTC Save where he went for Educational studies. TTC Save was a little bit confusing and difficult because of religious people's environment and pressure, but Jean Jacques was able to resist. When the High School National Examination results were published, he had a sholarship to go to the University of Rwanda, College of Education normally known as KIE</p>.

		           <p> At the end of Secondary School Studies, Jean Jacques applied to <a href="http://www.kepler.org/apply/">Kepler</a> through a friend's small phone. After the application, Itorero, Urugerero and other government programs went on as a requirements for all the secondary school graduates. In addition to that, it was time to start thining about finding a job in schools around since he had a diploma in Education. As he hunted for jobs, he was not able to get one but instead had good news from <i><u>Dan Nkundwanayo</i></u> that both of them were admitted to Kepler. The news were good for Jean Jacques, his family and friends since he was going to have a chance to move from the village to Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. Again, he was going to start learing from a new Learning System that he was not familiar with which seemed challenging at the time. Here are people that Jean Jacques thanks because they helped him to integrate in the new learning System.</p>
